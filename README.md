# WellSpent

It is a chance to bring together what you have learned about interface design and explore how UI can positively impact the world. 

Description: 

1. Pick a problem in the world that you think is important.   Hunger, poverty, addiction, loneliness, natural disasters, illness, conflict...  these are big problems.  Are there parts of this problem that you could isolate and work on?  Describe how a user interface could help address this problem, even if only in some small but meaningful way.  In your documentation describe your idea for how a UI could help.  I would envision people writing 2-4 paragraphs here, and including some sketches to help develop and illustrate your ideas.

WellSpent is an utility tracking app/website that is meant to track a household's water usage. Ideas for this were taken from Duke Energy's dashboard that I use for my electricity and gas usage. Based upon the usage, I tend to alter the usage and be more considerate of the appliances I'm using. 

WellSpent aims to capture the usage of water for a household and breaking it down into specifics such individual tap usage, shower lengths, water quality, trends in water usage, and an option to donate to a non-profit organization determined to clean our water sources and promoting sustainable water practices. 

3. Design a basic prototype of a portion of this envisioned interface.   Consider what would illustrate your interesting and impactful idea.  It should be served publicly on the web, so we can interact with it. 

The prototype for WellSpent started off from a spark from my Duke Energy metaphor to now creating the sketches as below.

4. Document how the UI works, using text descriptions, screenshots and a demo video.  Follow the format we have used for previous projects.
